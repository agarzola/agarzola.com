        <p>This is an experiment.</p>
        <p>It’s been over ten years since I last updated my website. <em>That’s too fucking long.</em> Inspired today as I was years ago <a href='https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/a-grand-experiment/' title='A Grand Experiment, a blog post on Aaron Gustafson’s website'>when I saw Aaron Gustafson do the same</a>, I’ll be doing an open redesign of this website in the coming weeks and months. I’ll write a blog post about it when the time is right.</p>
